  <h1>SEI IND Summary: ITEPEKIMAB-χ1</h1>
  <p><strong>Submission Type:</strong> Logic-Derived Investigational New Drug (LD-IND)</p>
  <p><strong>SEI Submission Date:</strong> 2025-06-04</p>
  <p><strong>Intended Sponsor:</strong> Moleculogic Research Division</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Product Description</h2>
    <p>ITEPEKIMAB-χ1 is a hybrid MDC-FDC therapeutic designed to partially modulate the IL-33/ST2 axis in patients with COPD, while simultaneously promoting epithelial repair and suppressing adaptive cytokine compensation. The compound integrates logic-tuned nanoparticle delivery, stratified immune modulation, and regenerative circuit design.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Rescue Justification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="label">Original Compound:</span> Itepekimab (Regeneron/Sanofi)</li>
      <li><span class="label">Reason for Failure:</span> Inconsistent Phase 3 efficacy due to lack of epithelial repair, cytokine rebound, and trial homogeneity</li>
      <li><span class="label">SEI Rescue Solution:</span> New blueprint designed with entropy-stabilized logic, repair overlay, and stratified trial design</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Delivery & Dosing</h2>
    <p>Administered via inhaled microparticle system, delivering localized therapeutic payload to pulmonary tissue with conditional activation based on oxidative stress and IL-33 activity threshold.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Patient Stratification Logic</h2>
    <p>Enrollment will be restricted to patients with:
      <ul>
        <li>IL-33 expression ≥ 1.3x baseline</li>
        <li>Epithelial Damage Index (EDI) ≥ 0.6</li>
        <li>High exacerbation history within 24 months</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Toxicity and Safety Simulation</h2>
    <p>SEI-modeled adverse event risk is classified as “Low”, with specific modules preventing rebound inflammation and fibrosis. Cytokine overshoot potential is reduced by >70% relative to original design.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Projected Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expected ≥ 65% reduction in moderate/severe exacerbations at 52 weeks</li>
      <li>Entropy score stabilized at 0.17 by Week 52</li>
      <li>Improved lung remodeling as measured by epithelial integrity biomarkers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
